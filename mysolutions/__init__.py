"""
This module provides a sample entry-point for your aocd "plugin".
advent-of-code-data runner will repeatedly call your entry point
with varying year (2015+), day (1-25) and input data. The only
requirement is: your entry-point should be a callable which must
return a tuple of two values.

Note: On Dec 25 there is only one puzzle, but you should return
a tuple of 2 values anyway, e.g. (part_a_answer, None) the
second value of the tuple will not be used regardless.

The AOC_SESSION is set before invoking your entry-point, which
means you can continue to use `from aocd import data` if you
want - it's not strictly necessary to define worker functions
which accept the input data as an argument (although, this is
usually a good practice, so that you can easily check your code
provides correct answers for each of the puzzle test cases!)
